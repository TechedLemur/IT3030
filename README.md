# IT3030 - Deep Learning

Deep Learning course at NTNU. The course consists of 3 projects regarding neural networks.

## Project 1 - Implementing Backpropagation

Customizable neural network implemented in Python without the use of deep learning libraries like Tensorflow and PyTorch.

Calculations are done as matrix operation with Numpy.

Also includes a self-made data-generator which generate images containing different shapes, which can be used to test the neural network.

## Project 2 - Deep Generative Models

Implemented standard Auto-Encoders and Variational Auto-Encoders for use on a 3-channel MNIST dataset.

## Project 3 - Time series forecasting with LSTMs

Forecast power grid imbalance using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based model.
